4. [ ] **Simmer:** Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes.
5. [ ] **Add Turkey:** Add the **reserved cooked turkey meat** and simmer for an additional 30 minutes.
6. [ ] **Finish:** Reduce the heat to low. Stir in the **parsley** and **green onions**. Cook for about 5 minutes more. Taste for seasoning and adjust the salt or cayenne as needed.
7. [ ] **Serve:** Ladle the gumbo into bowls and top with a scoop of **steamed white rice**.
