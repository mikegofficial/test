# Angie 80085 Greek Soup (Avgolemono)

## Serves
(Serving size not specified)

## Ingredients

- [ ] 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs
- [ ] salt and pepper
- [ ] olive oil
- [ ] 1 onion, diced
- [ ] 2 carrots, diced
- [ ] 2 celery ribs, diced
- [ ] 5 cloves of garlic, minced
- [ ] 6 cups chicken stock
- [ ] 1 bay leaf
- [ ] 3 sprigs thyme
- [ ] 1/2 cup jasmine rice
- [ ] 5 egg yolks, or 3 eggs
- [ ] 1.5 lemons, juiced
- [ ] minced parsley for garnish

## Directions

1. [ ] Start by sautéing the **onion** in **olive oil** in a large pot or Dutch oven.
2. [ ] Add **carrot**, **celery**, and **garlic** to the pot and continue to sauté until the vegetables are translucent.
3. [ ] Add in the **chicken thighs** and **chicken stock**, along with the **bay leaf**, **thyme sprigs**, and **jasmine rice**. Season with **salt and pepper**.
4. [ ] Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender (about 20-25 minutes).
5. [ ] Once the chicken is cooked, remove the chicken thighs from the pot. Shred the chicken using two forks, then add the shredded chicken back into the soup.
6. [ ] In a separate bowl, whisk together the **egg yolks** (or 3 **eggs**) and **lemon juice**.
7. [ ] **Temper the eggs:** Slowly scoop about 2 cups of the hot broth from the pot into the egg and lemon mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling or clumping.
8. [ ] Slowly pour the tempered egg-lemon mixture back into the pot with the soup. Mix well.
9. [ ] Serve immediately, garnished with **minced parsley**. yo
