| 30 minutes | 45–55 minutes | ~1 hour 25 minutes | 1 9x5 loaf |

## Ingredients

- [ ] 6 ounces (170 grams) unsalted butter, melted and browned to just over ½ cup
- [ ] 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
- [ ] ¾ cup (150 grams) lightly packed light sugar
- [ ] 1 teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] ½ teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] ¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- [ ] ½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- [ ] ¼ cup (65 grams) sour cream
- [ ] 1¼ cups (about 3 medium) very ripe bananas, mashed
- [ ] 1 heaping cup milk or semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1.  Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease and flour a 9×5-inch loaf pan and set aside.
2.  In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. The butter will foam and crackle as it melts—keep swirling the pan. Once the crackling subsides, the milk solids will begin to brown on the bottom of the pan and the butter will smell nutty and caramelized. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately pour the browned butter into a small bowl to stop the cooking. Allow to cool slightly.
3.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg until everything is evenly combined and there are no sneaky pockets of flour hiding out. Make a well in the center and pour in the wet ingredients all at once.
4.  In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs with the vanilla and sour cream until silky and well combined. Stir in the mashed bananas – we're welcoming a few soft banana lumps; they're part of the charm. Once the browned butter has cooled to just warm (so it doesn't scramble the eggs), slowly stream it in while whisking. We're looking for a glossy, cohesive mixture that smells like bananas and toffee, smooth, but not whipped with tons of air.
5.  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients; start from the bottom of the bowl and lift the batter over itself until no dry streaks remain. The trick here is to mix just until combined. Overmixing makes a tough loaf, and we're going for tender and soft.
6.  Fold in most of the chocolate chips, saving a few for the top.
7.  Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Top evenly with the reserved chocolate chips.
8.  Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to rest in the pan for 15 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy warm or at room temperature for up to 4 days.

## Notes

*   Browning the butter first builds layers of nutty, toffee-like flavor, forming the foundation of the loaf's rich, caramel notes.
*   Avoid overmixing the batter once wet and dry ingredients are combined to ensure a tender and soft loaf.
*   Choose very ripe bananas with brown spots on the peel for optimal natural sweetness and a stronger banana flavor.
*   The bread can be stored well-wrapped at room temperature for up to 4 days.
